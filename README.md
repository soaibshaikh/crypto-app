#Crytoverse App (Using React js, redux toolkit,Ant Design,Rapid API)
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### cryptoverse app 

The Crypto App project is a React.js application built using Redux Toolkit, Rapid API, and Ant Design. It aims to provide users with real-time information and analysis of various cryptocurrencies. The application utilizes Redux Toolkit, a powerful state management library, to efficiently manage the application's state and handle asynchronous actions.

By integrating with Rapid API, the Crypto App accesses reliable and up-to-date data on cryptocurrency prices, market trends, and other related information. This allows users to stay informed about the latest developments and make well-informed investment decisions. The app leverages the extensive range of endpoints provided by Rapid API to fetch data such as historical price charts, market summaries,cryptocurrency related news and individual coin details.

To enhance the user experience and ensure a visually appealing interface, the project utilizes Ant Design, a popular React UI component library. With Ant Design, the Crypto App achieves a consistent and responsive design across different devices and screen sizes.

The Crypto App offers a range of features, including the ability to view real-time cryptocurrency prices, track portfolios,  and access comprehensive market analysis tools. Users can easily search and filter cryptocurrencies, view detailed coin information, and monitor their investments in a user-friendly dashboard.

Overall, the Crypto App combines the power of React.js, Redux Toolkit, Rapid API, and Ant Design to deliver a feature-rich and user-friendly platform for crypto enthusiasts and investors. It provides a seamless experience for tracking cryptocurrency market trends, making informed decisions, and staying up-to-date with the ever-changing world of cryptocurrencies.

The app includes a Line Chart to display crypto price trends and integrates with a news API to fetch and display crypto-related news.
